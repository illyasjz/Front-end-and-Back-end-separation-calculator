# Front-end-and-Back-end-separation-calculator
The calculator is finished by c++ with qt, mysql and I use visual studio to do the work. The calculator can perform basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder and clear functions. Besides, I also added the ability to delete, fraction and upsidedown. According to the requirement, the calculator has function of history and ANS. The former display the past 10 expressions with results in a new window, the latter display the past result in the lineEdit. The 2 functions are all archived by mysql. I used to use mysql to connect the database directly but failed many times. So to be replaced I use ODBC to connect the database. But it seems to have created new problems. The calculator can work with only 2 numbers and complex calculations with multiple numbers and bracket are impossible. You can only do further operations by press any operators, digits or dot.
